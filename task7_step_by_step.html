1. Open your browserâ€™s extension/add-ons manager
   - Chrome: Visit chrome://extensions/
   - Firefox: Visit about:addons

2. Review all installed extensions carefully
   - Check each extension: Do you use it? Do you trust it?

3. Check permissions and reviews for each extension
   - View permissions under 'Details'
   - Google extension name to read user reviews

4. Identify any unused or suspicious extensions
   - Unused extensions
   - Unknown developers
   - Excessive permissions

5. Remove suspicious or unnecessary extensions
   - Click 'Remove' or 'Disable'
   - Confirm removal

6. Restart browser and check for performance improvements
   - Reopen browser
   - Look for speed, fewer popups, etc.

7. Research how malicious extensions can harm users
   - Search topics like:
     - "Browser extensions that steal data"
     - "Malicious Chrome extensions examples"

   - Example:
     Extensions Removed:
